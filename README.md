# Atliq-Business-360-dashboard

The Atliq Hardware Business Insights 360 Dashboard is a comprehensive and interactive business intelligence solution developed using Power BI to provide a holistic view of the organization’s performance across finance, sales, marketing, and supply chain functions. The dashboard was designed to consolidate complex datasets and deliver actionable insights to stakeholders, supporting strategic decision-making at every level of the business.

The data used in this dashboard was sourced from multiple structured SQL databases, where SQL queries were written to extract relevant tables and perform initial joins, filtering, and aggregation. This approach helped optimize data loading and ensured that only necessary data flowed into the model. Once the data was extracted, Power Query was utilized extensively for data cleaning and transformation. It enabled tasks such as removing duplicates, handling null values, converting data types, and creating calculated columns like Year-Month, Quarter identifiers, and time-based flags. Complex data transformation logic was applied to normalize datasets, ensuring they aligned with the overall model structure and were ready for analysis.

The data model was designed using a Snowflake Schema, which minimized redundancy and optimized performance. Fact tables such as Sales, Marketing, and Supply Chain were connected to multiple dimension tables like Customer, Product, Segment, Region, and Calendar. The snowflake modeling allowed efficient relationship management and ensured the dashboard remained highly interactive, enabling users to perform cross-filtering and drill-downs seamlessly across various business perspectives.

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) formulas were used extensively to create dynamic and powerful calculated measures, adding depth and intelligence to the reports. Key financial metrics such as Net Profit %, Gross Margin %, Operational Expenses, and Year-over-Year growth were created using advanced DAX functions. Time intelligence features were also incorporated to enable users to view historical trends and cumulative figures across different time periods. Similarly, customer and product-level profitability, sales contribution, and growth matrices were generated to provide detailed insights into business performance.

The dashboard comprises several functional views tailored for different teams. The Finance View presents a detailed Profit & Loss statement, breaking down revenue, costs, and margins over time. The Sales View provides customer and product performance analysis, unit economics, and visualizations like bubble charts and doughnut charts to highlight top and bottom performers. The Marketing View includes region-wise performance matrices, enabling comparative analysis of markets like APAC, EU, LATAM, and NA. Additionally, the Supply Chain View focuses on forecast accuracy, net error, and risk profiles, helping identify issues such as excess inventory or out-of-stock risks. The Executive View consolidates top-level KPIs and trends, offering management a snapshot of overall business health.

Interactivity is a core strength of this dashboard. Users can filter and slice data dynamically based on market, region, customer, product segment, fiscal year, or specific quarters. Drill-through capabilities allow users to jump from high-level metrics to granular views of specific customers, products, or regions. Every visual on the report is interconnected, providing seamless cross-filtering and making the dashboard highly responsive to user selections.

Overall, this Business Insights 360 Dashboard not only streamlines reporting and analytics but also enhances decision-making capabilities by providing clear, visual, and data-driven insights. Leveraging SQL, Power Query, DAX, and Snowflake modeling, this dashboard serves as a powerful tool for Atliq Hardware’s finance, sales, marketing, supply chain, and executive teams.
